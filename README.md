Agile Final Project
# I am thrilled for this final project!
I can't say enough how happy I am that I chose to take this Agile / Scrum course 
because it is surely preparing me for the Scrum Master certification course and 
a few others. _The only problem I had was the Burndown Chart_ piece because the 
Reports menu didn't show it in the practice exercises. Other than that, this was 
a pretty cool exercise. 
**Not even the final exercise showed a Burndown Chart option** in the Reports menu. 
It does show a Sprint Report, which looks like one. 
The last steps of the final exercise were tricky..._very_ tricky.
**I included the Checklist** in agile-final-project. It was like a puzzle.
Such fun! Thank you!
