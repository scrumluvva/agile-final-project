Agile Final Project
# I am thrilled for this final project!
I can't say enough how happy I am that I chose to take this Agile / Scrum course 
because it is surely preparing me for the Scrum Master certification course and 
a few others. The only problem I had was the Burndown Chart piece because the 
Reports menu didn't show it in the practice exercises. Other than that, this was 
a pretty cool exercise. Thank you.
